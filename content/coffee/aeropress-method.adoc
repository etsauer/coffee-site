The great thing about the Aeropress is how easy it can be to use, and how forgiving it is when you don't get a recipe quite right. This makes it the ideal choice for traveling and for beginners just getting into coffee. I use mine most often as the brewer in my link:/coffee/travel-kit/[Travel Kit] that I use in offices and hotel rooms across the country.

This is the method that I use with the Aeropress when I'm on the road. The beauty of it is that it is very forgiving. I don't travel with a scale or a digital kettle so I've tried to keep it all simple. In a hotel room, I use the little in room coffee maker with the brew basket removed to heat bottled water. In the office, I get my water from the hot water spigot in the break room coffee makers. Either way, with the exception of a few places that just used terrible water, I've had no problem making an enjoyable cup.

== Software

[.ingredients]
* **Coffee**: 20 grams
* **Grind**: Medium-fine; _setting 4 of 13 on my Porlex Mini hand grinder_
* **Water**: 220 grams plus extra for heating the filter and mug
* **Water Temp**: 206&#8457;
* **Total Time**: about 2:15

== Hardware

[.ingredients]
* An Aeropress
* A paper or cloth filter

== Brew Steps

1. **Set up** your Aeropress upside down with the plunger inserted into the chamber just far enough so that you don't see any rubber when you look at it from the side.
2. **Pre-wet** your filter, lid & mug by placing filter cap upside down in your cup or mug.
3. **Grind** your coffee and add it to the chamber. Shake the chamber so that you have a nice even bed.
4. **Start your timer** and quickly pour your water in to just below the lip. You want to get all of the grounds saturated as quickly as possible so that the coffee extracts evenly.
5. **Stir** the grounds just enough to ensure all the grounds are saturated.
6. **Cap** the brew chamber with the filter, and ensure it is screwed on tight.
7. **Flip.** At 1:30, carefully pick up your Aeropress, holding both pieces and turn it right side up so that the filter is setting in your cup.
8. **Plunge** firmly and slowly until you hear the hiss of air.

Drink & Enjoy!
