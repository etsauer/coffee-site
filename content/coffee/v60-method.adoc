I bought my clear plastic link:https://www.hario.jp/[Hario v60] for $6 to take on a camping trip in 2011, and now years later is my go-to brewer. It is one of the best brewer options for any coffee with lighter body and fruit notes. Lately I've been using a cloth filter from link:http://coffeesock.com/[CoffeeSock] instead of the typical Hario paper filters.

== Brew Steps

1. **Preheat and pre-wet** your filter and mug with 150g - 200g of water.
+
_TIP #1: Don't be an idiot like me. Dump out your water before you brew!_
2. **Add your ground coffee** to the filter and shake it to even it out.
3. **Bloom.** Start your timer and quickly pour out 65 -75 grams of water.
4. **Gently mix** the grounds and water with a spoon or Aeropress stir stick so that all of the grounds get wet as quickly as possible.
5. **Pour.** Start at 0:45 and pour gently but quickly, filling the brewer, until you reach 360 grams.
+
_TIP #2: Be sure to hit the grounds on the edge, but don't hang out there too long._
6. Allow a **draw down** until about 3:00
7. Get a sip of the good stuff.
