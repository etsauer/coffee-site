I love coffee so much that I created a website about it just for fun! I want to help others enjoy it too. To the end, I think its important that we start at the beginning. If you're interested in exploring the world of coffee, and would like to have a better experience in your cup, then you are in the right place.

== What is Brewing?

_Brewing Coffee_ is the act of bringing ground particles of a coffee bean in contact with water.

_... wait, that's it? ..._

Yes. That's it.

The lukewarm water and coffee grounds that mix together after I've spilled them on my kitchen counter as I'm attempting to make my morning cup would be considered brewed coffee. And, if I think about it, I might rather drink that than some of the coffees I've tasted in the offices I visit during my day job.

However, there's much more that goes into a great cup of coffee than simply getting some beans wet.

_Brewing Great Coffee_ is the process of dissolving soluble solids, gases, and oils from coffee beans such that it brings out desirable flavors while avoiding undesirable flavors. To do this, the brewer (human or machine) must ensure that all of the coffee in the brew dissolves evenly, and that the process stops at the right moment to capture the right flavors. Stop the process too early, and the coffee will taste sour and acrid. Stop the process too late, and the coffee may taste bitter, dry, burnt, or papery.

== So, What affects how my coffee tastes?

There are many many variables that can affect the flavor of coffee. While trying to avoid overly detailed explanations, the following are the top 4 most important factors in making great coffee.

=== 1. Coffee Quality

First, and foremost the quality, type, _origin_ (where the coffee comes from), and _freshness_ (number of days since roasting) of the coffee beans are the largest factor in the quality of your cup of coffee.

A good indicator of high quality coffee is one that:

- *Tells you what it is and where it came from* - look on the packaging for country, region, farm of origin
- *Tells you when it was roasted* - look for a "roasted on" date, and shy away from coffees that are more than a month past roast

=== 2. Grind Quality

Great coffee is ground fresh before brewing and is ground to a uniform size. This helps to ensure that the coffee _extracts_ evenly. The size of the grind depends on how the coffee is being brewed, and can also depend on the coffee itself.

Ground coffee should always be ground using a _burr grinder_, not a _blade grinder_.

A _blade grinder_, which basically acts like a blender, is basically the equivalent of attempting to chop a pile of beans with a kitchen knife in each hand.. you're going end up with grinds of all kinds of different sizes, which means some grounds will _over extract_, creating very bitter or burnt flavors, and others will _over extract_, resulting in unpleasant sourness, "grassiness", and other undesirable flavors.

A _burr grinder_ on the other hand uses toothed wheels or cones that fit closely together to crush the beans. A good burr set will have very sharp teeth to cleanly cut into the beans, and the distance between the burrs determines grind size. Burr grinders, therefore, produce much more consistent grinder than blade grinders and are always preferred.

_There are a lot of good burr grinders on the market for all kinds of different use cases, which I don't want to get into just yet. In an attempt to help you get going, however, if you are simply looking for a low-cost, entry level grinder that will allow you to make great coffee, I would start with something like link:https://www.amazon.com/Hario-Ceramic-Coffee-Mill-Skerton/dp/B001802PIQ/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1525649598&sr=8-4&keywords=hand+crank+burr+coffee+grinder[this]._

=== 3. Brewing Device and Method

There are a ton of different brew devices out on the market, and each typically has many different methods for using them. In general, brewing devices fall into one of two brewing styles (or occasionally a hybrid of the two).

==== Immersion

_Immersion brewing_ refers to brewing coffee by soaking the grounds in water for a period of time. After the right amount of time, the mixture is then forced through a filter of some kind, which allows the liquid to pass through, and holding the undissolved grounds behind. Immersion brewing is most commonly done through some type of coffee press, such as a French press, or the newer and very popular Aeropress.

Coffee brewed using immersion methods tend to have bigger body, heavier mouthfeel, and therefore is more popular for use with coffees that have chocolately, nutty, or savory flavors. However, Immersion brewers are typically pretty versatile and can make great coffees across the spectrum.

_If you are looking to get started with coffee, I highly recommend the Aeropress as a good place to start for its forgivness and simplicity. Checkout our link:/coffee/aeropress-method/[simple brew guide] for the Aeropress to get started using it._

==== Drip & Pourover

_Drip brewing_ is the process of making coffee by water passing through a bed of coffee grounds. The grounds typically sit in a filter placed bed of some kind with a small opening in the bottom. Water is poured over the bed of grounds, wetting the coffee, and the extracted coffee flows out of the hole(s) in the bottom of the brew bed.

This is the method used by most automatic home coffee makers.

The key to making great coffee with a drip method is ensuring that the grounds all get wet evenly and at the same time. This can be a challenge and unfortunately is done very poorly in most automatic machines.

_Pourover brewing_ is a sub category of drop brewing, which typically implies a manual process of pouring water over a bed of coffee. There are MANY different pourover devices available, but the two most iconic are probably the link:https://www.amazon.com/Hario-Ceramic-Coffee-Dripper-White/dp/B002IR1O3A/ref=sr_1_5?s=kitchen&ie=UTF8&qid=1525652786&sr=1-5&keywords=hario%2Bv60&th=1[Hario v60] and the link:https://www.amazon.com/Chemex-Classic-Collar-Coffee-Filters/dp/B017M89J1I/ref=sr_1_6?s=home-garden&ie=UTF8&qid=1525652911&sr=1-6&keywords=chemex[Chemex].

=== 4. The Water

Water is the most prevalent ingredient in coffee. It stands to good reason that the quality of the water in your coffee matters. At a minimum, coffee should be brewed with water put through a high quality filtration system. I use water out of my refrigerator's filtration system, and have had very good results. More recently, I've been using link:https://thirdwavewater.com/[Third Wave Water], which is a packet of minerals you add to distilled water to make "the perfect brew water".

The temperature of the water is also huge factor in how a brew turns out. The temperature of water link:http://www.middleschoolchemistry.com/lessonplans/chapter5/lesson6[affects the rate at which things dissolve] in it. It stands to reason, then that differences in water temperature will change how much a coffee will be extracted. Espresso, for example, is intended to be brewed very quickly, and therefore tends to be brewed at near boiling temperatures (205&#8457; - 212&#8457;). Cold brew, on the opposite end of the spectrum may be brewed over the course of several hours to several days. Most traditionally brewed coffees are brewed at temperatures between 195&#8457; and 205&#8457;.

== What else to say?

I'm not sure what else should go here.
