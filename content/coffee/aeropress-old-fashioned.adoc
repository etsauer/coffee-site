This is a fun and refreshing change of pace drink. Part coffee, part cocktail, but still appropriate for work!

== The Software

[.ingredients]
* 30 grams coffee beans
* 200 grams water at 203&#8457;
* 2 or 3 dashes agnostura bitters
* orange peel
* 3/4 oz simple syrup

== The Hardware

[.ingredients]
* Aeropress
* Kettle
* Grinder
* Cocktail shaker
* Low ball glass

== Method

1. **Grind the coffee** to a not quite espresso fineness. (on Baratza grinders it would be an 8/30)
2. **Brew the coffee** in your link:/coffee/aeropress-method/[inverted Aeropress].
3. **Cool the coffee** at least to room temperature. You can let it set out or stick in the fridge if you're patient, but I prefer to brew it right over some fake ice cubes. Just don't use real ice made of water.
4. **Make the drink**. In a cocktail shaker _with real ice_ combine the coffee, simple syrup and bitters and _SHAKE WITH ALL YOUR MIGHT_ for 20 seconds or so.
5. **Pour the drink** through a fine mesh strainer into a low ball glass over ice.
6. **Serve the drink** garnished with the orange peel. Roll the peel between your thumb finger over the glass to get all those essences out.
