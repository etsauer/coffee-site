Yields 1 cocktail

== Software

[.ingredients]
* 1/2 oz fresh lime juice
* 1/2 oz demerara syrup
* 1 oz unaged column still rum (such as Lassiter's NC Rum)
* 3/4 oz aged pot still rum
* 1/4 oz coffee infused rum (such as Lassiter's Rum au Cafe)
* 1 dash mole bitters
* Garnish: lime wheel or peel

NOTE: I love the mole bitters with this drink. Get it if you can. If you can't a tiki bitters would do nicely, or plain old Angostura is nice too. Just don't skip the bitters altogether.

== Hardware

[.ingredients]
* Boston-style Cocktail shaker
* Jigger
* Coupe glass
* Cocktail Strainer
* Fine Mesh strainer

== Instructions

. Place all ingredients in the small half of a cocktail shaker.
. Add 12oz ice to the shaker.
. Chill coupe glass by filling it with ice and a splash of water (so the ice doesn't stick).
. Shake until frost forms on the outside of the shaker.
. Dump the ice from coupe glass.
. Double strain into glass and serve with a lime wheel or peel.

Cheers!
